    <p style="text-align:center;">Welcome to the tantalizing world of Sri Lankan traditional foods! Situated on the tropical island of Sri Lanka, this culinary paradise is renowned for its rich and diverse flavors that reflect the island's vibrant history, multicultural influences, and abundant natural resources.
        Sri Lankan cuisine is a true celebration of spice, color, and texture, offering a delightful array of dishes that cater to every palate.
    <p style="text-align:center;padding-bottom: 1%;">Passed down through generations, these traditional foods are not just meals but also a reflection of the country's unique cultural heritage. 
        At the heart of Sri Lankan cuisine lies rice, the staple food, which is often accompanied by an exquisite assortment of curries. 
        These curries feature an explosion of flavors, blending aromatic spices such as cardamom, cinnamon, cumin, coriander, and cloves. Whether it's the fiery hot "Ambul Thiyal," a tangy and sour fish curry, or the comforting "Dhal Curry" made with lentils, each curry has a distinct personality that takes your taste buds on an unforgettable journey.
        One cannot talk about Sri Lankan cuisine without mentioning the iconic "Hoppers" and "String Hoppers." Hoppers are bowl-shaped pancakes made from rice flour and coconut milk, while String Hoppers are delicate steamed rice noodle nests.</p>
        These delightful creations are typically enjoyed for breakfast or dinner and are often paired with aromatic coconut sambal, a condiment made with grated coconut, chili, lime, and sometimes a hint of Maldive fish.
        For those seeking a taste of something sweet, Sri Lanka offers an indulgent range of traditional desserts. "Kiri Bath," a creamy and fragrant rice pudding cooked with coconut milk, is often enjoyed on special occasions and festivals. 
        Meanwhile, "Watalappan," a scrumptious caramel-like custard infused with jaggery and spices, is a beloved treat with Malay origins.
        Sri Lankan cuisine also <span  id="1" >boasts</span> an intriguing variety of street food, with "Kottu Roti" taking center stage. This delectable dish is a blend of chopped flatbread, vegetables, eggs, and your choice of meat or fish, all stir-fried together and seasoned with a tantalizing array of spices.
        As you embark on your culinary adventure through Sri Lankan tradition foods, be prepared to be enchanted by the warmth of its people, the heritage of its recipes, and the incredible tapestry of flavors that will leave an everlasting impression on your palate and in your heart.

    <p >Rice and curry is the quintessential and most popular meal in Sri Lanka, as well as in other South Asian countries like India and Bangladesh. 
        It refers to a meal where steamed or boiled rice is served with an assortment of curries, typically consisting of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options.
         Rice and curry is an integral part of <span id="2">Sri Lankan</span> culture, and it can be enjoyed at any time of the day, from breakfast to dinner. </p>

    <h2 style="padding-top:20px;">2.Kottu Roti</h2>
    <p>Kottu Roti is a popular and beloved street food in Sri Lanka. 
        It is a unique and flavorful dish made with shredded flatbread (roti) stir-fried together with an assortment of vegetables, eggs, and a choice of meat or fish. 
        The dish is prepared on a hot griddle (iron sheet) using two metal blades that make a distinct rhythmic clashing sound as the ingredients are chopped and mixed.
        Kottu Roti is not only delicious but also a <span id="3">delightful</span> culinary experience. It's a must-try dish for anyone visiting Sri Lanka, offering a true taste of the country's vibrant street food culture.</p>

    <h2 style="padding-top:20px;">3.Hoppers and String hoppers</h2>
    <p> Hoppers, locally known as "Appa," are bowl-shaped pancakes made from a fermented rice flour batter.
         The batter is made by grinding rice and mixing it with coconut milk, yeast, sugar, and a pinch of salt.
          The mixture is left to ferment for several hours, which gives the hoppers their distinctive slightly sour taste and airy texture.
          String hoppers, known as "Idiyappam" in Sri Lanka, are delicate noodle-like strands made from rice flour. 
          Unlike hoppers, there's no fermentation involved in making string hoppers. Both hoppers and string hoppers are delicious and versatile dishes, loved by locals and tourists alike. 
          They showcase the creativity and culinary <span id="4">diversity</span> of Sri Lankan cuisine, making them a must-try for anyone visiting the country.</p>

    <h2 style="padding-top:20px;" >4.Malu Ambulthiyal</h2>
    <p >
        Seafood plays a significant role in Sri Lankan cuisine, as one might anticipate from an island in the Indian Ocean.
         Among the numerous distinct fish curries that are offered, fish ambul thiyal (sour fish curry) is one of the most favored types.
        A mixture of spices, including black pepper, cinnamon, turmeric, garlic, pandan leaves, and curry leaves, are saut√©ed with the fish, which is typically something large and firm, like tuna.
         Dried goraka, a little fruit that gives the fish its sour flavor, is arguably the most crucial component.
        Ambul thiyal is a dry <span id="5">curry</span> recipe, which means that all of the ingredients are boiled together with a little water until the water is reduced. This enables the spice mixture to cover every fish cube.

    <p>
        Milk rice, known as "Kiribath" in Sri Lanka, is one of the most iconic and traditional dishes in the country. 
        It holds significant cultural and religious importance and is often prepared and enjoyed on special occasions and festivals. 
        The term "Kiribath" translates to "milk rice" in English, where "kiri" means milk, and "bath" refers to rice. 
        Kiribath holds cultural and symbolic importance in Sri Lanka, and it is often associated with auspicious occasions 
        such as the <span id="6" >Sinhalese</span> and Tamil New Year, weddings, and religious ceremonies.

    <p >
        Wambatu Moju, also known as "Brinjal Moju" or "Eggplant Moju," is a popular and mouthwatering Sri Lankan dish that perfectly 
        exemplifies the island's love affair with tangy and spicy flavors. 
        This traditional delicacy features eggplant, locally known as "wambatu," which is cooked in a

            This traditional staple food holds a special place in the hearts of Sri Lankans and is enjoyed across the island as a comforting breakfast, lunch, or dinner option.
            The preparation of pittu begins with rice flour, which is typically made from red or white rice. The flour is moistened with water and a pinch of salt,
            creating a crumbly texture that resembles coarse <span id="8">breadcrumbs</span>. Freshly grated coconut is then mixed into the rice flour, adding a natural sweetness and 
            enhancing the overall taste.</p>
