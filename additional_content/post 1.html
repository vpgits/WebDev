<h1>How to Make the Ultimate Pizza with Fermented Tomato Sauce, Smoked Bacon, and Homemade Cheese</h1>
<p>Do you want to make the ultimate pizza? A pizza that has fermented tomato sauce, smoked bacon, and homemade cheese? A pizza that takes 10 days to make from scratch? If so, you're in for a treat, because we're going to show you how to do it. But be warned: this pizza is not for the faint of heart. It requires patience, dedication, and love. And a lot of humor.</p>
<p>Ready to start? Here are the steps you need to follow:</p>
<h2>Make the sourdough pizza dough</h2>
<p>This is the base of your pizza, and it needs to be light, airy, and crispy. To achieve this, you need to use sourdough starter, which is a mixture of flour and water that has been fermented by natural yeast and bacteria. You can buy sourdough starter online or at some bakeries, or you can make your own by following <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-starter-recipe">this guide</a>. You will need to feed your starter every day for about a week until it is bubbly and active. Then, you can use it to make your pizza dough by following <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-pizza-crust-recipe">this recipe</a>. You will need to let your dough rise overnight in the fridge, then shape it into balls and let it rest for another hour at room temperature before stretching it into pizza rounds. Don't worry if your dough is sticky or uneven, that's part of the charm.</p>
<h2>Make the fermented tomato sauce</h2>
<p>This is the sauce that will give your pizza a tangy and complex flavor. To make it, you need to ferment some cherry tomatoes with salt, garlic, and basil for about 3 days at room temperature. You can use <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-fermented-tomato-sauce-234402">this method</a> to do it. After 3 days, you will notice that the tomatoes have released some juice and become soft and wrinkly. That's when you know they are ready. You can blend them with some olive oil and oregano to make a smooth sauce, or leave them whole for a chunky sauce. Either way, you will have a delicious and unique tomato sauce that will make your pizza stand out.</p>
<h2>Make the homemade cheese</h2>
<p>This is the cheese that will make your pizza creamy and gooey. To make it, you need to heat some whole milk in a pot until it reaches 180¬∞F, then add some lemon juice and stir gently. The milk will start to curdle and separate into curds and whey. You can use a cheesecloth to strain the curds and squeeze out the excess whey¬π[1]. Then, you can season the cheese with some salt and herbs, or leave it plain. You will have a fresh and soft cheese that is similar to ricotta or cottage cheese. You can use it as it is, or blend it with some cream cheese to make it more spreadable.</p>
<h2>Cook the smoked bacon</h2>
<p>This is the topping that will make your pizza smoky and savory. To cook it, you need to cut some thick slices of smoked bacon into small pieces and fry them in a skillet over medium-high heat until they are crisp and golden. You can drain them on some paper towels to remove the excess fat. You will have some crunchy and flavorful bacon bits that will add some texture and contrast to your pizza.</p>
<h2>Assemble and bake the pizza</h2>
<p>This is the final step where you put everything together and bake your pizza in a hot oven. To do this, you need to preheat your oven to 500¬∞F and place a pizza stone or a baking sheet inside. Then, you need to stretch one of your pizza dough rounds into a thin circle and place it on a piece of parchment paper. You can spread some of your tomato sauce over the dough, leaving some space around the edges. Then, you can sprinkle some of your cheese over the sauce, and top it with some of your bacon bits. You can also add some fresh basil leaves or red pepper flakes for some extra flavor and color. Then, you need to slide your pizza onto the hot pizza stone or baking sheet and bake it for about 10 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted. You can repeat this process with the remaining dough and toppings, or freeze them for later use.</p>
<h2>Enjoy your pizza!</h2>
<p>This is the best part where you get to enjoy your hard work and savor your delicious pizza. You can cut your pizza into slices and serve it hot or cold, with some salad or soup on the side, or just by itself. You can share it with your friends or family, or keep it all for yourself. You can be proud of yourself for making such an amazing pizza from scratch, using natural and homemade ingredients.</p>
